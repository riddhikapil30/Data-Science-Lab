#Consider the books dataset BL-Flickr-Images-Book.csv from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/adeyoyintemidayo/publication-of-books) which contains information about books. Write a program to demonstrate the following. 
# Import the data into a DataFrame 
# Find and drop the columns which are irrelevant for the book information. 
# Change the Index of the DataFrame 
# Tidy up fields in the data such as date of publication with the help of simple regular expression. 
# Combine str methods with NumPy to clean columns

import pandas as pd
